## Normal Expressions
The program is pretty straightforward. You type an expression into the calculator, and the calculator will try to extract equations and symbols from your entry. If it doesn't understand something, it will tell you.

As this is a C++ program, trying to decompile human input, there are some rules as to what symbols you can use. This is only a basic calculator, so does not understand BIDMAS. Additionally, it will not function the same as a scientific calculator. I might fix this, I probably won't though.

> + - Addition
